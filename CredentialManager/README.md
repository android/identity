# Credential Manager Sample App

This is the repository for the Credential Manager API code integration. app.
It is a **work in progress** üöß.

The **Credential Manager Sample APP** is a fully functional Android app built
entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This sample app is built to share a
working sample of Credential Manager APIs in Android and help visualize the
workflow. The intention is to help developers understand the workflow better
and allow them to estimate the changes required in their app easily.

## Features

This sample app implements the following use cases:

* Create an account using username and set the session using password.
* Generate a new passkey for an account
* Store the credentials for created accounts on the device.
* Sign in flow with passkeys support
* Logout from the account.

## Typical account creation and login flow

* Launch the app
* Create an account by sending any username to the server.
* Sets session by sending a password in step 2.
* Register user credentials using your fingerprint sensor.
* From the list of passkeys options shown in bottomsheet select the correct
  passkey option to login.
* Logout of the application and close the app
* [Optional] Create multiple accounts and switch accounts to test the
  implementation.

## Requirements

* Android Studio
* Java 11
* Clone your own Glitch.me server from this link:
  https://glitch.com/edit/#!/credential-manager-app-test using *Remix to
  edit* and add package and SHA for your application.
* Use your own debug.keystore if needed for signed builds sample project -app
  testing

## How to setup your own Glitch.me server 

The app sends requests to a server at
https://credential-manager-app-test.glitch.me/

You are going to work on your own version of the Glitch backend. The backend
code uses your Android package and SHA which needs to be updated on the
server.

To create your own version of the Glitch backend. The backend code uses your
Android package and SHA which needs to be updated on the server.

* Go to the edit page of the website at
  https://glitch.com/edit/#!/credential-manager-app-test
* Find the *"Remix to Edit"* button at the top right corner. By pressing the
  button, you can "fork" the code and continue with your own version along
  with a new project URL.
* Copy the project name on top left (you may modify it as you want).
* Paste it to the `.env` file's `HOSTNAME` section in Glitch.
* To use the API on an Android app, associate it with a website and share
  credentials between them. To do so, use Digital Asset Links. You can
  declare associations by hosting a Digital Asset Links JSON file on your
  website, and adding a link to the Digital Asset Link file to your app's
  manifest. Host `.well-known/assetlinks.json` at your domain
* You can define an association between your app and the website by creating a
  JSON file and put it at `.well-known/assetlinks.json`. For this demo, we
  have a server code that displays an `assetlinks.json` file automatically,
  just by adding following environment params to the .env file in glitch:
* `ANDROID_PACKAGENAME`: Package name of your app
  (e.g. `com.example.android.fido2`). You can find the package name in your
  project's app-level `build.gradle` file as the value of the `applicationId`
  property within the `android` block.
* `ANDROID_SHA256HASH`: SHA256 hash of your signing certificate. To get the
  SHA256 hash of your developer signing certificate, use the command
  below.
  * `$ keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore`
  * The default password of the debug keystore is *"android"*.
  * The *SHA256* value appears under *Certificate fingerprints*.
    (`75:89:78:74:...`)
* In your `build.gradle`'s `android` block, find `buildConfigField` for
  `API_BASE_URL` and `resValue` for `host`, and update these values to
  reflect the new hostname of your remixed Glitch.me server.


## Development Environment

This app uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into the
[latest stable version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
The `debug` build can be built and run using the default configuration.

## Integration

### Initialization steps

Initialize your Credential Manager to use further for creating user credential
and authentication purposes.

Note: Wait for the toast to appear for respose success/failure on each step.

### Create an account for username on server

* Click on the ‚ÄúStep 1: Send Username‚Äù button after adding a username/email in
  the 1st field. For the purpose of demonstration, the app and the server
  accept any username. Just type something. ( call `sendUsername()` request
  from `AuthRepository`)
* Check username, create a new account if it doesn't exist.
* Set a `username` in the session.
* Wait for the toast to appear saying "Username verified successfully".
* If you don't see toast, check the logs for error.

### Set a session on server

* Next, check ‚ÄúStep 2 : Send Password‚Äù. Above that, add any password (This is
  for demonstration purposes only). Type and send the request (call password
  () request from AuthRepository)
* This step is to demonstrate if developers want to do additional
  authentication (2FA). This step shows how 2FA can be done while using
  passkeys for authentication.
* Verifies user credential and let the user sign-in.
* No preceding registration required.
* Wait for the toast to appear saying "Session-id stored successfully, Do
  register!"
* If you don't see toast, check the logs for error. 

### Pass required information to a passkey creation prompt

This section describes how to send a registration request to server and pass
the required information to a passkey creation prompt.

* Next, you need to register the passkey credential. Inside
  `AuthRepository.kt`, find `registerRequest`.
* Once the request is sent from the client, this method calls the server API
  `/auth/registerRequest`. The API returns an `ApiResult` with all the
  `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` that the client needs to generate a new
  credential.

### Create a Passkey

* Next, you need to create Passkey with the response received
  from /registerRequest
* For that, you need to first parse the params as per needed for the Create
  Credentials call.  (Call
  ‚ÄúcreatePasskey()‚Äù from Auth.kt)
* Give users the choice to enroll a passkey and use it for re-authentication,
  by registering a user credential using a CreatePublicKeyCredentialRequest
  () object.
* This method will call ‚ÄúcreateCredential()l‚Äù from Credential Manager apis,
  which helps Register a user credential that can be used to authenticate the
  user to the app in the future.
* This method execution launches framework UI flows for a user to view their
  registration options, grant consent, etc.
* Use your fingerprint or other auth. Methods from your device to register.

### Send the registration response and register a user credential

This section describes how to send a registration response back to server and
register a user credential on a server.

* After this, you need to call `/registerResponse`. This `registerReponse`
  method is called after the user interface successfully generates a new
  credential, and you want to send it back to the server.
* Now you will use the response received from the `ceatePasskey()` call, and
  pass it back to your server.
* You now want to remember the ID of your local key so you can distinguish it
  from other keys registered on the server. In the PublicKeyCredential
  object, take its `rawId` property to be sent.
* The returned value contains a list of all the credentials registered on the
  server, including the new one.

### How to retrieve previously stored credentials for user‚Äôs account

You now have a credential registered on the app and the server. You can now
use it to let the user sign in.

* As similar to creating the passkey, Open `AuthRepository.kt` and check
  `signinRequest`. Here, you want to request the server and see if you can
  let the user sign in with Credential Manager APIs. This method takes
  `sessionId` and `credentialId` stored locally.
* Once the request is successful, you need to prompt the user with all the
  stored credentials for his account. Call `getPasskey()` from `Auth.kt`.
* This calls `GetCredentialRequest()`:  Pass these registration options to
  this method. This method also takes a boolean `isAutoSelectAllowed()` which
  can be used if you want a credential entry to be automatically chosen if it
  is the only one, this is false by default.
* For now, Pass `PublicKeyCredentialOptions` as parameters to the above method
  to retrieve all credentials for this particular user. This takes
  `requestJson` which is already sent in required webauthn web JSON format.
* Next, call `CredentialManager.getCredential()` which launches the
  bottomsheet. This bottom sheet will show all the previously saved
  credentials and ask the user to provide consent.
* Users can select the credential to authenticate.

### Send a sign-in response and authenticate the user

This section describes how to send a sign-in response to the server and
authenticate your user.

* Call `signinResponse` from `AuthRespostory.kt`. Pass response and
  credentialed to the method as params.
* Once successful, the user has been signed in successfully. You can redirect
  them to the home screen.

## Specific use case handling

* When there are no passkeys associated with accounts registered, the
  developer should catch the exception code and let the user know that first
  he needs to create a passkey before they try to fetch it.
* For **Begin Sign In Failure:  16:** Caller has been temporarily blocked due
  to too many canceled sign-in prompt errors: This is a FIDO-specific error.
* For **Begin Sign In Failure:  8: Unknown internal error.** If the phone
  isn't setup properly with a Google account, the passkey JSON is being
  created incorrectly.
* For **`publickeycredential.CreatePublicKeyCredentialDomException`:
  The incoming request cannot be validated**: This means your application
  package ID is not registered with your server. Validate this with your
  server code (instructions below).

### How to build a debug signed version

To build a debug signed version of this sample app, you need to update the
`API_BASE_URL`  to "https://credential-manager-app-test.glitch.me/auth" and
host field to "https://credman-glitch-sample.glitch.me" under
`buildConfigField` in your `build.gradle` file.
